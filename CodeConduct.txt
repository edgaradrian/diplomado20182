Human Rights
Always be alert to possible human rights violations.
PepsiCo recognizes the importance of maintaining and promoting fundamental human rights in our operations and supply chain, and we are committed to respecting the rights of workers throughout our value chain. Our Values, Code, sustainability strategy and busi- ness policies work together to support the principles contained in the United Nation’s International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization Fundamental Principles and Labor Standards. We operate under programs and policies that:
• Promote a workplace free of discrimination and harassment
• Prohibit child labor, forced labor and human tra cking
• Provide fair and equitable wages, bene ts and other conditions of employment
in accordance with local laws
• Provide humane and safe working conditions, including safe housing conditions,
where applicable
• Recognize employees’ right to freedom of association and collective bargaining
We expect our suppliers and business partners to uphold these principles as well.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct, Sustainable Sourcing Program and Sustainable Farming Initiative are tools we use to communicate our expectations and to minimize the risk of human rights abuses throughout our supply chain.
Always check your actions to ensure that they do not violate or contradict any of the basic human rights principles noted above. If you suspect a human rights abuse within our operations or supply chain, speak up and report it.
